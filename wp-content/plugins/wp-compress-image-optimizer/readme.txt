### Load Faster, Rank Higher & Convert Better on Autopilot

Simply link your website and you’re good to go – with no maintenance required after setup.

_It’s really that easy._
___
### LOADED WITH AGENCY FEATURES
Not only is the plugin great for speeding up individual websites, but it’s fully loaded with industry leading Agency features such as:

- Monthly Client Quotas
- Centralized Management Portal
- Detailed Client Reporting
- Remote Configuration & Optimization
- Bulk Website Linking

- Think of it as a fully managed solution, where you get to take the credit for faster loading client websites!
___
### LOCAL AND LIVE OPTIMIZATION MODES

_**WP Compress is an all-in-one image optimization and delivery solution**, and you may use any or all components as you desire._

**Local Image Optimization** is the traditional method, allowing you to compress your media library and image thumbnails as well as generate additional image formats such as Next-Gen WebP.

**Live Image Optimization** is the next-generation of image compression, plus the ability to serve the perfect image every time.

It pairs real-time compression with:
- **Adaptive Images (by device)**
- **Next-Gen WebP images**
- **Retina Device Support**
- **Image Lazy Loading**

... and our **Lightning-Fast Hybrid CDN** from Google Cloud and BunnyCDN to serve your images in just milliseconds across the entire globe.

No matter which mode  you choose, WP Compress will speed up your images which can significantly lower your bounce rate and increase conversions, leading to increased website ROI.

_You can even use both, to save local space but also reap the incredible benefits of live image optimization._
___
### Much more than just compression

Traditionally, image optimization has been reducing image quality in turn for file-size savings, with the concept that smaller images load faster.  That’s no longer the case with WP Compress v5!

We’ve found an incredible solution that speeds up your images, without visible loss in quality, then serves the properly sized and formatted images through our ultra-premium infrastructure for load times as fast as 7ms.
___
### DELIVER THE PERFECT IMAGE, EVERY TIME

It’s much more than just image compression, true image optimization power comes from the trifecta of image sizes and formats that we generate in real time.

**Next-Gen WebP Images:**

We’ll convert and generate WebP images then we’ll automatically serve WebP images to supported browsers for higher quality images with even smaller file sizes and even faster load times.

**Adaptive Images** _(By Device)_:

Based on the incoming visitors device and screen size we’ll adapt your images to be the right size every time. This allows for massive file size savings and faster images, with no visible quality differences to the human eye.

**Retina Support:**

We’ll generate retina images when possible and serve retina images to supported devices for a high resolution experience on even the sharpest of screens.

**Example 1:** _William is visiting your website on a 27in 5K iMac in Google Chrome, he’ll be served a WebP image that's perfectly sized based on the container you’ve put it in, then doubled for retina support to look absolutely brilliant on his screen._

**Example 2:** _If he then decides to check back on Safari, he’ll automatically get a retina .png or .jpg for the same image as the browser does not support WebP images._

**Example 3:** _He loves your website’s images and fast load time so much, he then sends it to his wife who checks on her mobile device, she’ll be served the same image at say a 480px width, saving precious file-size and data needed to load the image over mobile - without sacrificing the clarity to the human eye!_

___
### LIGHTNING-FAST, ULTRA PREMIUM HYBRID CDN
It’s no secret that global is the new standard. The beauty of having a website is that anyone can access your site anywhere in the world, anytime of the day or night.

For that to happen, your website files have to be transferred from your web-server then downloaded to the end users device.

That was fine when it was html and text based websites, but with the emergence of rich content and higher resolution imagery, transferring unnecessarily large image files across the world can take a few seconds each.

Think about it... It’s nearly 17,000 Kilometers (or 10,500+ Miles) from your hosting server in London to Sydney, Australia... a standard image can take 5s to load over that distance.

_But now we’re loading that image in as little as 7 milliseconds ...that’s faster than you can even blink._

After the trifecta of Adaptive Images, WebP Support and Lazy Loading, the finishing touches come from our hybrid Content Delivery Network or CDN for short.

The CDN is the final step of an already magnificent optimization process, delivering your images faster than you can ever imagine.

Your website visitors will no longer be stuck waiting for the heavy files to load, better yet you’re starting the relationship out on the right foot.

_Live Image Optimization with the CDN is recommended; however not required and can be toggled off with the local image optimization mode._
___

### PRECONFIGURED FOR YOU, YET EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE

You’ll be good to go the moment you paste your access key into the WP Compress plugin. It comes pre-configured in live mode with what we think are the optimal and most supported settings - but feel free to play around!

**For Example:**
- If you want to optimize your images using local mode then switch back to live mode you can in one click.


- If you want to try out WebP, Retina or Adaptive Images you can do each in one click.


- If you want to use Lazy Load from a third party, you can toggle ours off in one click.

###### It’s really that simple and built for compatibility.

>With millions of possible combinations, there are vast differences in environment from one WordPress website to the next. Whether it be plugins, themes, hosting permissions or server specifications - there’s a lot of variability.

That’s the beauty of a toggle system, you can simply turn something on and if there are ever any conflicts or issues, simply toggle it off and everything will revert back to how it was.

_We offer industry leading live chat support, simply reach out and we’ll be happy to help if any plugin, theme or other conflict arises._
